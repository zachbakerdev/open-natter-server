# Open Natter Server

Official server for OpenNatter, an open source chat app alternative!

## Description

Apps like Discord are great, but now, Discord is adding advertisements. This hurts the usability of the platform and OpenNatter is my attempt at designing an effective alternative.

In addition, the second goal of OpenNatter is to provide a solution for secure internal communications within companies that:

1. Don't want to spend money on Teams or Slack
2. Must manage their own data on premises
3. Need customized features that are unique to their organization

The open source nature of this project is designed to encourage companies and individuals to modify code and contribute functionality ot better suit their needs and the needs of others.
